%ROCKPROP input file (rpi)

%Define equations for each property and zones to apply to, in MATLAB syntax.
%Begin each property section with the property name.
%End each equation and zone definition with a "stop" statement.
%The final "stop" statement for each property should be led by the property name (e.g. porositystop).
%All property, stop, and propertystop statements should be in all lowercase.

%The final function in each set must be called "FUN", but may contain any number of subfunctions.
%Use ALL CAPS for all variable or function definitions, to avoid confusion with the main program.
%The "FUN" function for porosity must include an input for depth.
%All other "FUN" functions must include inputs for both depth and porosity.

%The compressibility section must include definitions in each zone for both grain density and specific heat of grains.
%These values are required for output to the .rock file, and may also be used to define "FUN".
%Use "RHOG" for grain density.
%Use "SPECHEAT" for specific heat of grains.
