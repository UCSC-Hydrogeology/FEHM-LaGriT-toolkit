# FEHM Toolkit
This toolkit consists of utilities and convenience functions to enable fast and efficient use of [FEHM](https://github.com/lanl/FEHM) and [LaGriT](https://github.com/lanl/LaGriT), which are software packages created by Los Alamos National Labs for hydrothermal simulations.

## Work in progress
This toolkit is in the early stages of development and is not yet in working order. This page will be updated when an initial release is ready. Work to date is focused on collating and testing previous Matlab versions of the code.
